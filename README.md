# Virtual-Piano
The project idea is to design a GUI-based project where you can play a virtual piano to your heartâ€™s content. This project may look easy, but a lot of concepts are applied which are quite complex. Incorporation of asynchronous functions along with dealing with the different audio libraries will take some time.
